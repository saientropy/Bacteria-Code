# Bacteria Code

This repository collects a variety of small analysis and visualization scripts used to explore the mechanics of bacterial membranes.  The code base contains utilities for plotting pressure--strain relationships, generating animations, and processing experimental data.

The scripts are organised in a few main folders:

- **Analytical** – interactive notebooks and helper scripts for analytical models.
- **EVERYTHING** – assorted plotting utilities, animations and pressure calculations.
- **all other code** – miscellaneous prototypes and helper calculations.

Additional CSV data and generated figures are kept in the repository root.

See `docs/file_overview.md` for a brief description of each script.
